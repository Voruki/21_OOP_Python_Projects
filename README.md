The application generates and manages an encryption key, ensuring that all stored passwords remain encrypted and secure.
---

### [Project 8 - PIG](/08_-_PIG/)
#### This project is a dice game application designed for 2 to 4 players. Players take turns rolling a six-sided die, accumulating points each round unless they roll a 1, which ends their turn with no points. The first player to reach the maximum score of 50 wins the game. The application manages player turns, scores, and determines the winner.
---

### [Project 9 - Madlibs Generator](/09_-_Madlibs_Generator/)
#### This project is a story processor application that reads a story from a file, extracts placeholders, prompts the user for words to fill those placeholders, and then prints the modified story with the user's inputs. It provides an interactive and customizable storytelling experience.
---

### [Project 10 - Timed Math Challenge](/10_-_Timed_Math_Challenge/)
#### This project is a math quiz game that generates random arithmetic problems for the user to solve. It includes addition, subtraction, and multiplication problems with operands ranging from 3 to 12. The quiz consists of 10 problems, tracks the number of incorrect answers, and measures the time taken to complete the quiz. The results are displayed at the end, providing feedback on performance.
---

### [Project 11 - Slot Machine](/11_-_Slot_Machine/)
#### This project is a slot machine simulation game where players can deposit money into their balance, choose the number of lines to bet on, and place bets on each line. The slot machine generates a spin result with symbols arranged in a grid format. The game checks for winning combinations across the selected lines and calculates winnings based on predefined symbol counts and values. Players can continue spinning until they choose to quit, and their final balance is displayed when they decide to stop playing.
---

### [Project 12 - Turtle Racing](/12_-_Turtle_Racing/)
#### This project is a turtle racing simulation program that allows users to specify the number of racers (2 to 10) and watch as colored turtles race across a graphical interface. Each turtle moves randomly forward in each race iteration until one reaches the finish line, upon which the winner's color is displayed.
---

### [Project 13 - WPM Typing Test](/13_-_WPM_Typing_Test/)
#### This project implements a WPM (Words Per Minute) Typing Test using curses library, where users are prompted to type a randomly selected line of text from a file. The test measures typing speed in real-time, displaying the current input, the target text, and calculated WPM. Users can correct mistakes with backspace and complete the test, after which results are shown and users can choose to continue or exit.
---

### [Project 14 - NBA Stats and Current Scores](/14_-_NBA_Stats_and_Current_Scores/)
#### This project utilizes the NBA API to provide real-time information on NBA games and team statistics. It includes functionalities to fetch and display current game scores and key statistical leaders, such as points per game (PPG), for NBA teams.
---

### [Project 15 - Currency Converter](/15_-_Currency_Converter/)
#### This project utilizes the Currency Converter API from free.currconv.com to provide functionalities for retrieving currency information, converting between currencies, and obtaining exchange rates. It includes commands to list available currencies, convert amounts from one currency to another, and display the exchange rate between two currencies interactively via a command-line interface.
---

### [Project 16 - YouTube Video Downloader](/16_-_YouTube_Video_Downloader/)
#### This project enables users to download YouTube videos by providing a URL and selecting a directory to save the downloaded video. It utilizes the pytube library to handle the YouTube video download process and tkinter for the file dialog interface. Users input a YouTube URL, choose a save location through a file dialog, and the script downloads the highest resolution MP4 video available.
---

### [Project 17 - Automated File Backup](/17_-_Automated_File_Backup/)
#### This project automates daily backups of a source directory to a specified destination directory using Python's schedule and shutil libraries. It schedules a folder copy operation to run daily at any time that the user wants, ensuring data redundancy and preservation.
---

### [Project 18 - Shortest Path Finder](/18_-_Shortest_Path_Finder/)
#### This project uses the curses library to visualize a pathfinding algorithm navigating a predefined maze from the starting point 'O' to the endpoint 'X'. It employs a queue-based breadth-first search (BFS) strategy to explore and find the shortest path, updating the maze display in real-time.
---

### [Project 19 - Mastermind 4 Color Match](/19_-_Mastermind_4_Color_Match/)
#### This project simulates the classic Mastermind game where the player attempts to guess a randomly generated color code. The player has a limited number of attempts (10 by default) to deduce the correct sequence of colors. After each guess, the program provides feedback on the number of correctly positioned and incorrectly positioned colors. The game ends either when the player correctly guesses the code or runs out of attempts.
---

### [Project 20 - Aim Trainer](/20_-_Aim_Trainer/)
#### This project implements an aim trainer game using Pygame, where the player aims to click on randomly appearing targets within a specified time limit. Targets grow and shrink in size dynamically, and the game keeps track of hits, misses, and accuracy. The top bar displays real-time statistics including elapsed time, speed, hits, and remaining lives. The game ends when the player exceeds the allowed number of misses. Upon completion, the end screen shows final performance metrics.
---

### [Project 21 - Advanced Python Scripting](/21_-_Advanced_Python_Scripting/)
#### This project searches a specified source directory for subdirectories containing 'game' in their names, copies these directories to a target directory while renaming them, compiles any game code files (.go), and generates a JSON metadata file summarizing the copied game directories. It handles directory creation, overwriting existing directories, and executes compilation commands within each game directory found.
